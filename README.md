- 👋 Hi, I’m @jhoannachan!
- 👀 I’m interested in advancing my Python and data analytics expertise. I'm a newbie in tech! 
I have a business background so I want to use marketing and sales cases to develop my big data skills!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python on Codecademy's Data Science Path. It's been an interesting ride so far...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Github or any platforms.
